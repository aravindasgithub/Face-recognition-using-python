# Face-recognition-using-python
This Python-based face recognition system uses OpenCV to detect faces and extract features using SIFT or ORB. A KNN classifier is trained on labeled images for recognition. The system captures real-time webcam footage, detects faces, extracts features, and predicts identities.
